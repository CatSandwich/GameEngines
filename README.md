# GameEngines PLAR Portfolio

This readme file is the entire PLAR portfolio submission for Game Engines 2 - Advanced Scripting.

## Overview

Below are all of the course learning outcomes (CLOs) with the names I will be referring to them by.

**1. Explain concepts:** Explain the concepts of generics, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, extension methods, co-routines and delegates for the purpose of applying the advanced features of C# programming.  
**2. Use concepts:** Utilize the advanced C# programming constructs to efficiently code professional games within the Unity game engine.   
**3. Use managers:** Enhance code design using a game manager and a scene manager in order to create professional games.  
**4. Use source control:** Correctly implement source control software to manage versions of game code and effectively share their work with team members.  
**5. Collaborate:** As part of a team, apply collaborative skills to build small games according to industry standards.  

## Explain concepts

*The student should demonstrate each individual item noted with a code sample and documentation 
accompanied which explains each item. I would expect at least one paragraph for each component 
of why the decision was made to use this architectural component and why it was appropriate for 
the chosen use in a game.*

Below are links to one-script projects demonstrating (with comments) all of the concepts. I included 
them in the order that I believe they make most sense rather than the order they appear in the CLO.

- [Inheritance](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/Inheritance/Program.cs)  
- [Interfaces](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/Interfaces/Program.cs)
- [Polymorphism](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/Polymorphism/Program.cs)  
- [Generics](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/Generics/Program.cs)  
- [Extension Methods](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/ExtensionMethods/Program.cs)  
- [Delegates](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/Theory/Delegates/Program.cs)  
- [Co-routines](https://github.com/CatSandwich/GameEngines/blob/master/UnityTheory/Assets/Coroutines.cs)  

## Use concepts

*This should tie into CLO1, essentially these above architectural constructs / patterns should be 
demonstrated in games made using the Unity game engine specifically.*

### Inheritance

### Interfaces

### Polymorphism

### Generics

### Extension methods

### Delegates

### Co-routines

## Use managers

*These should feature singleton game managers with functions, variables and states applicable 
to both managers listed. Game Manager should be detailed for the specific game made therefor 
individual game managers.*

## Use source control

*This should demonstrate a GitHub repository online with branch based merged into a main or master 
branch. This should illustrate a history of pull requests, code reviews and merges with the 
master/main in a group dynamic with multiple users editing the same code base with overlapping 
work in the same code files. Students should document files which multiple (at least 2-3) 
programmers have edited the same file.*

## Collaborate

*This would be demonstrated using the same criteria as CLO4 however this adds the requirement 
for it to be multiple games. Ideally the student should have 3+ games on their public GitHub 
portfolio to showcase.*
